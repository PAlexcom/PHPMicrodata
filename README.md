PHPMicrodata [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PAlexcom/PHPStructuredData.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/PAlexcom/PHPStructuredData)
============
A PHP library to implement and output http://schema.org microdata semantics.    
This library was merged in the Joomla master branch and now available from version 3.2 (called [JMicrodata](https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/tree/master/libraries/joomla/microdata "JMicrodata")).  
Created during the Google Summer of Code 2013 for my Joomla! project.  

## Quick overview  
The library was designed with this goals in mind:  
1. __Having the possibility to switch the Microdata Type dynamically__, without the use of other overrides, you just change the Type (there are 558 different available types).  
2. Display  __validated semantics__, the library takes care to display it correctly.   
3. __Enable/disable the microdata__ semantics.   
4. __Fallbacks__, you should never lose any meaningful semantic.  
  
#### Example
Let's suppose that you allready use an istance of ```$microdata = new PHPMicrodata($type);``` the following code which is part of your article, and __you've selected__ ```$type="article"``` __the Article type__.
```php
<div <?php echo $microdata->displayScope();?>>
	<!-- Author of the content -->
    <span>
    	Written by <?php echo $microdata->content('Alexandru Pruteanu')->property('author')->fallback('Person', 'name')->display();?>
    </span>
    <!-- The content -->
    <?php echo $microdata->content('Here is the article text...')->property('articleBody')->display();?>
<div>
```
It will render:
```html
<div itemscope itemtype='https://schema.org/Article'>
    <!-- Author of the content -->
    <span>
    	Written by
        <span itemprop='author' itemscope itemtype='https://schema.org/Person'>
            <span itemprop='name'>Alexandru Pruteanu</span>
        </span>
    </span>
    <!-- The content -->
    <span itemprop='articleBody'>Here is the article text...</span>
<div>
```
Instead, if you decide to change the current Type, let's say __you change in__ ```$type="thing"```  __the Thing type__
It will render:
```html
<div itemscope itemtype='https://schema.org/Thing'>
    <!-- Author of the content -->
    <span>
    	Written by
        <span itemscope itemtype='https://schema.org/Person'>
            <span itemprop='name'>Alexandru Pruteanu</span>
        </span>
    </span>
    <!-- The content -->
    Here is the article text...
<div>
```
As you can see ```Alexandru Pruteanu``` __fallbacks__ to the Person type, and there is no loss of information, even if the current Type doesn't have an ```author``` Property it will display important semantic information for the machines, the search engines know that there is a Person ```Alexandru Pruteanu```. And everything is valid, done fast and automatically.
Instead, if you don't need all that microdata information, __you just disable that feature__ ```$microdata->enable(false)```.
It will render:
```html
<div>
    <!-- Author of the content -->
    <span>Written by Alexandru Pruteanu</span>
    <!-- The content -->
    Here is the article text...
<div>
```
Once again everything is done by the library. You don't need 558 different overrides, you just play with the global params.

## Documentation  
```PHPMicrodata``` library uses the ```types.json``` file to check and output validated Microdata semantics, that file was automatically created with the https://github.com/PAlexcom/Spider4Schema web crawler.   
      
For further documentation on ```PHPMicrodata``` see http://docs.joomla.org/microdata    
  

## Usage
First of all you need to make an instance of the library:  
```php
<?php $microdata = new JMicrodata('Article'); ?>
```
So let's suppose that you have the following _string_ which is part of your article and the current scope is _Article_:   
```php
<?php echo 'Written by Alexandru Pruteanu'; ?>
```  
And the microdata you need to add is an _author_ property:   
```php
<?php echo 'Written by ' . $microdata->content('Alexandru Pruteanu')->property('author')->fallback('Person', 'name')->display(); ?>
```  
The library will display:  
```html
Written by  
<span itemprop='author' itemscope itemtype='https://schema.org/Person'>
	<span itemprop='name'>
		Alexandru Pruteanu
	</span>
</span>
```
— What happens if the current scope is something else than _Article_, for example a _Product_ scope, and the current scope doesn't have an author property?  
Well it will fallback in:  
```html
Written by
<span itemscope itemtype='https://schema.org/Person'>
	<span itemprop='name'>
		Alexandru Pruteanu
	</span>
</span>
```
— If I want to disable the microdata semantics output?  
You can simply disable the microdata output by calling the following function:  
```php
<?php $microdata->enable(false); ?>
```  
The library will display the following:   
```html
Written by Alexandru Pruteanu
```
